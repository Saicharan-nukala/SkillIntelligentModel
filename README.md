# Skill Intelligent Model

A deep learning-based Skill Intelligence API that recommends relevant skills based on a user’s career goals, current skill set, and interests. It also supports learning path generation and skill swap suggestions between users.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Skill recommendation engine using NLP and deep learning
- 📚 Learning plan generation for any recommended skill
- 🔁 User-to-user skill swap suggestion system
- ⚡ FastAPI-based RESTful API
- 🧠 Pretrained skill classifier using embeddings + dense layers
- 📊 Custom dataset with 1800+ skills across multiple domains
